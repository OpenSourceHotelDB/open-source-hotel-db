# Starwood properties fetcher

### How to execute

1. Run `php starwood.php` from your console (if you're in a Mac, PHP comes bundled in)
2. Wait (probably good to leave it running all night)

All properties unmatched will be added to the output `starwood.json` file.

### TO-DOs

1. Remove invalid properties from the JSON (if they ever change it.)
2. Move / copy `starwood.json` to `data` folder on the top directory of the project.
3. Leave it running all night (@tomasdev will do it)
